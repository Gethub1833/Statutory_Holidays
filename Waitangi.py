'''Waitangi day is celebrated on the 6th of February, each year.
From 1 January 2014 the public holiday for ANZAC Day and Waitangi Day will be “Mondayised” if they fall on a Saturday or Sunday.

This means, if Waitangi Day or ANZAC Day fall on a Saturday or Sunday:

For employees who would not otherwise work on that Saturday or Sunday, the public holiday must be treated as falling on the following Monday.
For employees who would otherwise work on that Saturday or Sunday, the public holiday must be treated as falling on that day.
