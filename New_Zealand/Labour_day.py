'''
Queens Birthday
In New Zealand, the holiday is the first Monday in June.
Celebrations are mainly official, including the Queen's Birthday Honours list
and military ceremonies. There have been proposals, with some political
support, to replace the holiday with Matariki (MƒÅori New Year) as an official
holiday. The idea of renaming the Queen's birthday weekend to Hillary weekend,
after Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person to ascend Mount Everest, was raised
in 2009.
